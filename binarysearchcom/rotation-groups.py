# A rotation group for a string contains all of its unique rotations. For example, "123" can be rotated to "231" and "312" and they are all in the same rotation group.

# Given a list of strings words, group each word by their rotation group, and return the total number of groups.

# Constraints

#     n â‰¤ 200 where n is the length of words.
